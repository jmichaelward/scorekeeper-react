# Scorekeeper React
This is a React-based rewrite of my original [Scorekeeper app](https://github.com/jmichaelward/scorekeeper).
It was designed as a way for me to quickly and easily tally scores for a set of players in a given board or card
game.

## Demo
You can try out the site live at https://stuff.jmichaelward.com/scorekeeper. If you're on
iOS, you can save the app to your home screen and access it any time you need to calculate
scores!

## Installation
To install this project locally:
1. Clone down this repo: `git clone https://github.com/jmichaelward/scorekeeper-react`
2. `cd scorekeeper-react`
3. `yarn install`
4. `yarn start`

Once it's up and running, you should be able to access the project at `http://localhost:3000`.
