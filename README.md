# Scorekeeper React
This is a rewrite of the original [Scorekeeper](https://github.com/jmichaelwards/scorekeeper) app
I had written a few years back to log board game scores for those days when I don't have
a pen and paper handy. _That_ project started to solve a particular problem, and at some
point I'd done a rewrite of it to better understand some how to work with vanilla JavaScript.

Enter React – it's all the rage these days, and I've been periodically trying to learn and
understand its conventions, but since I write primarily PHP in my day-to-day work, the process
for learning how to write an app with it has been slow-moving. 

This rewrite began during a 5 for the Future day at [WebDevStudios](https://webdevstudios.com)
several months ago, and during the week of July 8th, WDS sponsored time for all of its staff
to attend Zac Gordon's terrific [JavaScript for WordPress](https://javascriptforwp.com) 
conference. Thursday of that week had a workshop on React, and it was super helpful and
motivating to see real-world examples coded live. That was the extra push I needed to 
revisit and finally launch this app to the world.

It's not perfect – I'm sure any seasoned React developer will find lots to loathe within
the codebase, but it's a starting point, and something I will continue to use every day.
If you're checking out this codebase, I hope you will, too!

## Demo
You can try out the site live at https://stuff.jmichaelward.com/scorekeeper. If you're on
iOS, you can save the app to your home screen and access it any time you need to calculate
scores!

## Installation
To install this project locally:
1. Clone down this repo: `git clone https://github.com/jmichaelward/scorekeeper-react`
2. `cd scorekeeper-react`
3. `npm install`
4. `npm run start`

Once it's up and running, you should be able to access the project at `http://localhost:3000`.

I'm not using any other special tools one might normally use - SCSS for processing stylesheets,
for instance, or perhaps other tooling – because the main goal here was to learn some React 
basics. So, if you need to customize this app for your own use, keep that in mind.

# Contributing
Since this repo was for fun and learning, I'm not really seeking contributions. That said, 
if you use the app and encounter any bugs, I would love to hear about it! Otherwise, feel free
to fork this repo and make it your own. I'm happy to get this out there and progress in 
my own learning journey of React.
